# FIRE Database Scraper
## Author
**Alex Tseng**

## Description
This project is a scraper for the FIRE Database, designed to automate data extraction and processing. The FIRE database is used to track freedom of speech incidents in college campuses around the US. However, the information is not easily accessible and poorly analysized. This repository was quickly setup to extract the information from this database so that freedom of speech scholars can better analyze the data.

This was designed specifically for use in Christopher Eisgruber's (Princeton University President) research on free speech in the US. 

## Features
- Efficient data scraping from the FIRE Database.
- Data cleaning and formatting.
- Request the data in different formats if required.
