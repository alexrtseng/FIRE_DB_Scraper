It applies the same values and criteria that we have used in the past to guide our actions. In no way does it diminish the remarkable academic achievements of any student considered or selected for valedictorian. To be clear: this decision has nothing to do with freedom of speech.

Get off our campus.” The speaker is Jewish and was discussing the history of Jews. Shouting down speakers for any reason is unacceptable at the University of Michigan. It violates our academic mission and our commitment to free speech and diversity of thought.

In a letter to the campus community the university president said: ""Since the 1990s, a brochure has been provided that explains to viewers the context of the murals’ composition and some of the historical reality of the events depicted. However, because the second-floor hall of the Main Building is a busy throughway for visitors and members of the University community, it is not well suited for a thoughtful consideration of these paintings and the context of their composition. We will, therefore, create a permanent display for high-quality, high-resolution images of the murals in a campus setting to be determined that will be conducive to such an informed and careful consideration. The murals on the walls of the Main Building will themselves be covered by woven material consistent with the décor of the space, though it will be possible to display the murals on occasion. I will establish a committee to decide on the place to display the images of the murals and the appropriate communication around the display.

Individuals who wish to enter the building must do so as members of the audience and must give the speaker a respectful hearing. Failure to grant the speaker a respectful hearing may result in the offending individual(s) being asked to leave.  Further, under the Policy, individuals may not, among other things, block or otherwise interfere with ingress and egress into and out of campus buildings, or engage in unlawfully harassing, physically abusive, threatening or intimidating, or lewd or obscene conduct toward any person. Students who violate any of the tenets of this Policy may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct, and faculty and staff offenders may be referred to the appropriate office for review, adjudication and potential discipline.  Disruptive activities and behavior are also subject to criminal charges, under the Maryland Statute (Section 26-101) that states: “A person may not willfully disturb or otherwise willfully prevent the orderly conduct of the activities, administration, or classes of any institution of elementary, secondary, or higher education.” Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to prosecution.
