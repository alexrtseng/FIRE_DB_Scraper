Students today knowingly violated those protocols, which is unacceptable. We will follow our internal processes to address the situation. 

The college president's revised statement a week later struck a different tone. Supported Speaker (Punished Hecklers for the Content of their Speech).  ""Last week’s event in which students chanted at an invited speaker was unacceptable. . . . [P]rotestors chose a chant that can be understood to be calling for the eradication of the State of Israel and is highly intimidating to Israelis and Jews, and directed it to an Israeli speaker discussing his perspective on Indigenous Jews. In the days following the incident, I have spent time speaking with and learning from students, faculty, alumnae/i, and experts in the field, and I now believe the use of the chant—in this way, directed at this speaker—crossed the line into antisemitism. We have begun our adjudication processes, which by federal law are confidential.

On this campus, we do not tolerate anti semitism, hate speech, or discrimination of any kind.
