Under AD51, however, there are requirements that must be followed including the prohibition of the use of sound amplification equipment between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. The student leaders of Turning Point USA were aware of this limitation and were explicitly reminded this morning before their event began that amplification was not permitted. After the event started, the group was asked to stop using amplification due to its violation of AD 51, which the University must enforce uniformly across events and groups.

Get off our campus.” The speaker is Jewish and was discussing the history of Jews. Shouting down speakers for any reason is unacceptable at the University of Michigan. It violates our academic mission and our commitment to free speech and diversity of thought. Doing so in a way that, in this case, targeted a person because of their Jewish identity is particularly abhorrent and will not be tolerated.
