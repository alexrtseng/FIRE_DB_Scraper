Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted Raskin a few minutes into his talk, shouting he was ""complicit in genocide"" and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Raskin attempted to engage the protesters saying he wished they would have a conversation, instead of heckling him. Protesters supporting Israel began arguing with the protesters supporting the Palestinians, forcing Raskin to end his speech early. Raskin then attempted to take questions from the audience but the shouting and arguing continued. The university president then decided to end the lecture early.","Appeased Protesters, Mistaken on the Law: The university president said: ""He came here to speak about where our democracy is going in our country. What you saw play out actually was democracy and free speech and academic freedom. From our perspective as a university, there are the difficult conversations that we should be having.""  Neutral: The university vice president for legal affairs and general counsel said: ""According to the Policy, no person may intentionally and substantially interfere with the lawful freedom of expression of others. Individuals shall not obstruct, disrupt, interrupt, or attempt to force the cancellation of any Program hosted by the University or by any users authorized to use University facilities or outdoor spaces. The Policy also goes on to state that “where an invited speaker is the object of protest, individuals may engage in Expressive Activity outside the building where the speech is taking place. Individuals who wish to enter the building must do so as members of the audience and must give the speaker a respectful hearing. Failure to grant the speaker a respectful hearing may result in the offending individual(s) being asked to leave.  Further, under the Policy, individuals may not, among other things, block or otherwise interfere with ingress and egress into and out of campus buildings, or engage in unlawfully harassing, physically abusive, threatening or intimidating, or lewd or obscene conduct toward any person. Students who violate any of the tenets of this Policy may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct, and faculty and staff offenders may be referred to the appropriate office for review, adjudication and potential discipline.  Disruptive activities and behavior are also subject to criminal charges, under the Maryland Statute (Section 26-101) that states: “A person may not willfully disturb or otherwise willfully prevent the orderly conduct of the activities, administration, or classes of any institution of elementary, secondary, or higher education.” Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to prosecution.  Along with the obligation to observe and protect the principles of free expression, we all must assume further responsibilities as members of our campus community. Indeed, members of the university community are expected to display civility, respect and other behaviors consistent with university policies and applicable laws, in exercising their, and in honoring others’, fundamental right to free expression.""""
